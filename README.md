# Calculator
A simple calculator built in Python using functions and basic control flow. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with input validation.
# ðŸ§® Function-Based Python Calculator

This is a beginner-friendly calculator program written in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with zero-division check)

### ðŸ’¡ Features
- Function-based modular code
- Input validation to ensure only integers are accepted
- Easy to read and extend
- Runs entirely through a single `main()` function call

### ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Run the script.
2. Enter the first number, operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`), and the second number.
3. Get the result printed on the screen.

### ðŸ“š Concepts Used
- Functions
- While loop
- Input validation using `.isdigit()`
- Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)
